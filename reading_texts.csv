2,expository,"""Green spaces in cities are very important for our environment and our health. Many cities around the world are trying to create more parks, gardens, and trees in their urban areas.\n""
""Cities with more green spaces have cleaner air. Trees and plants take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. This helps reduce air pollution, which is a big problem in many cities. When people breathe cleaner air, they have fewer health problems like breathing difficulties and heart disease.\n""
""Green spaces also help control the temperature in cities. Cities are usually hotter than the countryside because buildings and roads absorb heat from the sun. Trees provide shade and cool the air around them. This reduces the need for air conditioning in buildings, which saves energy and money.\n""
""Parks and gardens give people places to exercise and relax. Many city people do not have gardens at their homes. Public green spaces allow them to enjoy nature without leaving the city. Children can play safely in parks. Adults can walk, run, or sit quietly under trees. This is good for both physical and mental health.\n""
""Green spaces are also important for animals and birds. Even small parks can provide homes for different types of wildlife. This helps maintain biodiversity in urban areas. Birds, insects, and small animals need these green areas to survive in cities.\n""
""However, creating green spaces in cities is not easy. Land in cities is expensive, so it costs a lot of money to buy areas for parks. Sometimes old buildings must be removed to make space for new parks. This can be difficult because people may lose their homes or businesses.\n""
""City governments must also maintain green spaces after they create them. Parks need regular care to keep them clean and safe. Trees need water, especially during hot summers. This requires money and workers.\n""
""Another challenge is making sure all parts of the city have green spaces. Often, rich areas have more parks than poor areas. City planners must work to create fair access to green spaces for all citizens.\n""
""Despite these challenges, many cities are finding creative ways to add more green areas. Some cities plant trees along streets and on building rooftops. Others create small pocket parks in empty spaces between buildings.\n""",都市の緑が環境と健康に良い理由を2つ挙げて、簡単に説明してください。（50語以内）,都市で緑を増やすのが難しい理由は何だと思いますか。テキストの内容から答えてください。（50語以内）

""I felt extremely nervous on my first day of work. I had never gained experience in the service industry before. The manager, Mr. Tanaka, was incredibly patient and understanding. He demonstrated the proper techniques for preparing various coffee drinks and explained how to interact professionally with customers. My colleagues were equally supportive and offered assistance whenever I encountered difficulties.\n""
""Initially, every task seemed overwhelming. I struggled to memorize the extensive menu of beverages and their specific ingredients. My movements were slow and clumsy when operating the coffee machine. Occasionally, I made errors while handling cash transactions, which embarrassed me greatly. I felt terrible when customers became impatient due to long waiting times.\n""
""However, after approximately two weeks of consistent practice, my performance improved significantly. I developed greater efficiency in coffee preparation and gradually memorized the preferences of regular customers. These familiar faces always greeted me warmly with cheerful ""Good morning!"" expressions, which boosted my confidence considerably.\n""
""Currently, I genuinely enjoy my employment at the coffee shop. I maintain a schedule of working three afternoons weekly after completing my academic classes. The income I earn enables me to purchase textbooks and cover daily expenses independently. More importantly, this experience taught me valuable lessons about teamwork and communication skills. I also gained confidence in social interactions with diverse individuals.\n""

3,expository,"""Urban green spaces represent a crucial component of sustainable city development and significantly contribute to environmental quality and public health. Metropolitan areas worldwide increasingly recognize the importance of incorporating parks, gardens, and vegetation into their urban planning strategies.\n""
""Cities with abundant green infrastructure demonstrate measurably cleaner air quality. Trees and vegetation function as natural air purifiers by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis. This biological process effectively reduces atmospheric pollution, which constitutes a major environmental challenge in densely populated urban centers. When residents breathe cleaner air consistently, they experience reduced incidence of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and other pollution-related health complications.\n""
""Green spaces also provide essential climate regulation within urban environments. Cities typically experience elevated temperatures compared to surrounding rural areas due to the urban heat island effect, where concrete surfaces and buildings absorb and retain solar radiation. Trees offer natural cooling through shade provision and evapotranspiration processes, which release moisture into the atmosphere. This natural cooling mechanism reduces dependency on energy-intensive air conditioning systems, resulting in decreased electricity consumption and associated costs.\n""
""Public parks and gardens provide accessible recreational opportunities for urban residents. Many city dwellers lack private outdoor spaces, making community green areas essential for physical activity and mental wellness. These spaces accommodate diverse activities including jogging, cycling, yoga, and family gatherings. Children benefit from safe outdoor play environments, while adults can engage in exercise routines or simply relax in natural settings. Regular exposure to nature has proven psychological benefits, including stress reduction and improved mood.\n""
""Urban green spaces also support biodiversity conservation by providing habitats for various wildlife species. Even relatively small parks can sustain populations of birds, insects, and small mammals, contributing to ecological balance within metropolitan areas. These green corridors enable species movement and genetic diversity maintenance, which are essential for urban ecosystem health.\n""
""Nevertheless, implementing comprehensive urban greening programs presents significant challenges. Prime urban real estate commands extremely high prices, making land acquisition for park development financially demanding. Sometimes, existing structures require demolition to accommodate new green spaces, potentially displacing residents or businesses and creating social tensions.\n""
""Municipal governments must allocate substantial resources for ongoing maintenance of green infrastructure. Parks require regular landscaping, irrigation systems, safety monitoring, and facility upkeep. During drought periods, maintaining vegetation becomes particularly expensive and resource-intensive.\n""
""Ensuring equitable distribution of green spaces across all neighborhoods represents another critical challenge. Affluent districts often possess superior access to quality parks compared to lower-income areas. Urban planners must prioritize fair distribution of environmental amenities to prevent environmental injustice.\n""
""Despite these obstacles, innovative cities are developing creative solutions for expanding urban vegetation. Strategies include vertical gardens on building facades, rooftop gardens, and pocket parks in underutilized spaces between structures.\n""",都市緑化が環境と健康に与える効果を2つ挙げて、それぞれを簡潔に説明してください。（50語以内）,都市緑化を進める上で最も大きな課題は何だと思いますか。テキストの内容を参考に答えてください。（50語以内）
